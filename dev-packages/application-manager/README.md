## README

This package contains the generators used when creating a Theia application through `@theia/cli`.

This package can auto-generate application code for both the backend and frontend, as well as webpack configuration files.

When targeting Electron, the `electron-main.js` script will spawn the backend process in a Node.js sub-process, where Electron's API won't be available.
To prevent the generated application from forking the backend, you can pass a `--no-cluster` flag, or set an environment variable like `THEIA_ELECTRON_NO_BACKEND_FORK=1`.

```sh
# when developing a Theia application with @theia/cli:
yarn theia start --no-cluster

# when starting a bundled application made using @theia/cli:
bundled-application.exe --no-cluster
```
